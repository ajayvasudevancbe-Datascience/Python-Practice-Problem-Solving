""" Question 5: estimate_shipping_time """
"""
Inputs: a month (string) and day (integer)
Output: shipping time needed to ship an item on specified date with special cases:
        1. Most items ship in 10 days
        2. December is busy so items that ship in December take 5 days longer
        3. December 25 - end of year is even busier, so items shipped then take 
           5 more days
        4. Items that ship before the 7th of the month take 3 fewer days
           (This rule doesn't apply to December)
